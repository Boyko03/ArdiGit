The Osborne 1 was the first \n \
commercially successful \n \
portable microcomputer, \n \
released on April3, 1981, by \n \
Osborne Computer Corporation. \n \
It weighed 10.7 kg \n \
(24.5 lb), cost US$1,795, \n \
and ran the CP/M 2.2 \n \
operating system. Powered \n \
directly from a mains socket \n \
as it had no on-board \n \
battery, it was still \n \
classed as a portable \n \
device since it could be \n \
hand carried when packed. \n \
\n \
The Osborne 1 was developed \n \
by Adam Osborne and \n \
designed by Lee Felsenstein. \n \
It was first announced in \n \
early 1981. Osborne, \n \
an author of computer books, \n \
decided he wanted to break \n \
the price of computers. \n \
\n \
The Osborne's design was \n \
based largely on the Xerox \n \
NoteTaker, a prototype \n \
developed at Xerox PARC \n \
in 1976 by Alan Kay. \n \
The computer was designed \n \
to be portable, with a \n \
rugged ABS plastic case \n \
that closed up, and a \n \
handle. The Osborne 1 \n \
was about the size and \n \
weight of a sewing \n \
machine and was advertised \n \
as the only computer that \n \
would fit underneath an \n \
airline seat. It is now \n \
classified as a 'luggable' \n \
computer when compared \n \
to later laptop designs \n \
such as the \n \
 \n \
Epson HX-20. \n \
Despite its unattractive \n \
design and heavy weight \n \
the computer amazed \n \
observers. BYTE wrote, \n \
' it will cost $1795, \n \
and  it's portable!' \n \
($1795 is the equivalent \n \
of $4832 today.) The \n \
bundled word processing, \n \
spreadsheet, and other \n \
software alone was worth \n \
$1,500; as InfoWorld \n \
stated in an April 1981 \n \
front-page article on the \n \
new computer after \n \
listing the included \n \
software, 'In case you \n \
think the price printed \n \
above was a mistake, \n \
we'll repeat it: $1795.' \n \
\n \
Osborne claimed that \n \
the new computer had a \n \
'significant \n \
price/performance \n \
advantage' but emphasized \n \
the price, stating that \n \
its performance was \n \
'merely adequate': \n \
'It is not the fastest \n \
microcomputer, it \n \
doesn't have huge \n \
amounts of disk storage \n \
space, and it is not \n \
especially expandable.' \n \
Beyond the price, \n \
advertisements emphasized \n \
the computer's portability \n \
and bundled software. In \n \
the first eight months \n \
after April 1981, when \n \
the Osborne 1 was \n \
announced, the company \n \
sold 11,000 units. \n \
Sales at their peak reached \n \
10,000 units per month.  \n \
\n \
Its principal deficiencies \n \
were a tiny 5-inch (13 cm) \n \
display screen and use \n \
of single sided, single \n \
density floppy disk drives \n \
which could not contain \n \
sufficient data for \n \
practical business \n \
applications, and \n \
considerable unit weight. \n \
A single-density disk \n \
controller was used to \n \
keep costs down. As a \n \
result, the Osborne's \n \
floppy disks held a mere 90k. \n \
\n \
Later Osborne models \n \
switched to double-density \n \
controllers and an upgrade \n \
was offered to owners of the \n \
original model Osborne 1. \n \
In September 1981, Osborne \n \
Computer Company had its \n \
first US$1 million sales \n \
month. Sales of the \n \
Osborne 1 were hurt by \n \
the company's premature \n \
announcement of superior \n \
successor machines such as \n \
the Osborne Executive, \n \
a phenomenon later \n \
called the Osborne effect. \
