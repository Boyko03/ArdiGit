Technological School "Electronic Systems" at the Technical University of Sofia (TUES) was established in 1988 as part of the structure of the Technical University of Sofia. The school is a result of the realization of a very large and positive idea by large enterprises in the area of information and communication technologies, scientific organizations and associations. The aim was to create a secondary school to train high school graduates in the field of computer science and information technology. For the past 29 years, the school has prepared 24 teams of young specialists, many of whom have found professional realization and are leading positions in the development of information and communication technologies in Bulgaria.
